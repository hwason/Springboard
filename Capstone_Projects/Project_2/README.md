## Performance analysis of different machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval for businesses using real data from the U.S. Small Business Administration

The project analyzes the performance of the machine learning algorithms - Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines - in making predictions for loan approval for small businesses.

The project is organized as follows:
1. A project proposal describing the data science problem and the questions that are addressed (ProjectProposal_Capstone2.pdf).
2. A folder containing preprocessed and processed data, and models, saved during different stages of data analysis.
3. Three Jupyter Notebooks in three different folders, for different stages of the data science workflow:
   - Data wrangling (StepOne_DataWrangling)
   - Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing (StepTwo_EDA_Preprocessing)
   - Training and modeling (StepThree_Training_Modeling)
